# Availability Table
This availability table displays time slots across the week (Monday to Friday), showing how available someone is at different hours of the day. Each cell is color-coded to represent availability levels, with a legend indicating low (0) to high (5+) availability, making it easy to quickly compare free and busy periods at a glance.
